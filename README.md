### 🚀 Featured Projects

#### 1. [Metric Synthesis Engine](https://github.com/penghor315/metric-synthesis-engine) (New!)
**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Docker, Automated Testing
*A production-grade, hybrid AI architecture designed to eliminate hallucinations in financial reporting.*
- **Architecture:** Decoupled deterministic statistical analysis (Python) from narrative synthesis (LLM) to ensure 100% numerical accuracy.
- **Engineering:** Fully Dockerised for reproducibility with a custom automated evaluation framework (`evaluator.py`) to grade report quality.
- **Outcome:** Generated cohesive, grounded strategic reports with strict typing and robust logging.

#### 2. RAG Pipeline & Evaluation
**Tech Stack:** LangChain, RAGAS, Google Colab
*End-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline demo.*
- Implemented document ingestion and retrieval strategies.
- Evaluated performance using RAGAS metrics (faithfulness, answer relevance).
- [View Project (Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TS7ZvjzvHUPD8aaMDiuxNFO447579vaw?usp=sharing)

#### 3. Orpheus TTS (LoRA Fine-Tuning)
**Tech Stack:** Hugging Face PEFT, LoRA, PyTorch
*Fine-tuning a text-to-speech model for specific voice adaptation.*
- Demonstrated efficient fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
